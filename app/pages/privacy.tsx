                Welcome to <strong>Helios Gallery</strong>, where creativity, artificial intelligence, and a
                dash of humor collide! We&apos;re required to give you some legal mumbo jumbo, so here it goes:
              </p>
      
              <blockquote className="italic text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Sua sponte: Hereto within, both for consideration and exemplification in abeyance subject to
                adjudication pro se and terms whereto superseding justifies the underscore until res
                judicata thusly relieving ALL satisfactions. All parties hereby agree to wit habeas corpus.
              </blockquote>
      
              <p className="mb-4">Now that we&apos;ve satisfied the ancient spirits of legalese, let&apos;s get down to business.</p>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Privacy Is Overrated (But We Value Yours Anyway)</h2>
      
              <p className="mb-4">
                We firmly believe that privacy is both inconsequential and unimportant to you. If it were,
                you probably wouldn&apos;t have a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account, and you certainly
                wouldn&apos;t use search engines like Google. But hey, who are we to judge?
              </p>
      
              <p className="mb-4">
                However, to satisfy the absurd privacy requirements of various legal entities (and so you
                understand exactly where you stand with us), we&apos;re pleased to present our privacy policy:
              </p>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Information We Collect</h2>
      
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">a. Personal Information</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>When You Sign Up:</strong> We may collect your name, email address, and any
                  selfies you upload (preferably ones where you&apos;re rocking a toga).
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>When You Play Rock-Paper-Scissors:</strong> We keep track of your moves—not because
                  we&apos;re nosy, but because our AI enjoys a good game and wants to keep things interesting.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>When You Contact Us:</strong> Any information you provide when reaching out for
                  support, sending us fan mail, or sharing your deepest secrets (just kidding, please don&apos;t).
                </li>

                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Technical Data:</strong> Your IP address, browser type, device information, and a
                  history of the AI-generated masterpieces you create (yes, including that one).
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Game Data:</strong> Stats from your epic (or not-so-epic) battles against our AI in
                  Rock-Paper-Scissors. Don&apos;t worry; we won&apos;t judge if you prefer scissors every time.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Cookies:</strong> Not the chocolate chip kind, unfortunately. We use digital
                  cookies to enhance your experience (more on that later).
                </li>
              </ul>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> Tailoring content to make sure the Joke
                  Bot hits your funny bone every time.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>To Improve Our Services:</strong> Analyzing how you interact with our site and
                  games to make them even more awesome (or at least 10% more amusing).
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>To Enhance Your Gameplay:</strong> Using your game data to provide witty and
                  entertaining responses during Rock-Paper-Scissors. Our AI believes in friendly competition!
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> Sending updates, newsletters, or responding to
                  your messages (we promise not to spam—our Joke Bot handles that).
                </li>
              </ul>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal information. However, if the opportunity
                arises to sell or otherwise use this or any information about you, we will jump at that
                opportunity like a pitbull on a fresh steak. Just kidding! (Or are we?)
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">In all seriousness, we may share data with:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted partners who assist us in operating our
                  website and games (they&apos;ve signed strict NDAs—we checked).
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If the Greek gods demand it (or, you know, if
                  required by law).
                </li>
              </ul>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Security</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We employ industry-standard measures to protect your data. Our servers are guarded by
                virtual dragons and encryption spells. However, no fortress is impregnable, so if someone
                hacks us, blame the Titans.
              </p>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Cookies (The Digital Kind)</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We like chocolate chip cookies. By using our services, you agree to furnish any employee or
                associate of our company with fresh chocolate chip cookies upon request. That&apos;s the price of
                using our programs and services (in addition to any other price we come up with).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Wait, our legal team says we can&apos;t enforce that. Fine.
                <br />
                We use digital cookies to:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">Keep you logged in so you don&apos;t have to remember yet another password.</li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                  Understand how you use our site and games so we can make them better (like adding more
                  witty comebacks for our AI opponent).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>You can disable cookies</strong> through your browser settings, but be warned: your
                experience might be less delightful.
              </p>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Third-Party Links</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Helios Gallery may contain links to other websites, like our team members&apos; personal blogs or
                that hilarious cat video we couldn&apos;t resist sharing.

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>We are not responsible</strong> for the privacy practices of these external sites.

                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>We encourage you</strong> to read their privacy policies (even if they&apos;re not as
                  entertaining as ours).
                </li>
              </ul>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Our services are <strong>not intended for children under 13</strong>. If you&apos;re a
                tech-savvy kid genius, please get parental consent before joining the fun.
              </p>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We may update this policy occasionally (usually after our legal team has had their coffee).
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>We&apos;ll notify you</strong> of any significant changes by posting the new policy
                  here.

                <li className="mb-2">
                  <strong>Your continued use</strong> of Helios Gallery means you&apos;re cool with the updates.

              </ul>
      
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">10. Spam and Bacon</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You agree that nothing we do with the access and information you grant to us shall be called
                spam—even if it is. We prefer the term &quot;bacon&quot; because... mmmmmmmm bacon.
