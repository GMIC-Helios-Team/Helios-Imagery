                    <p>
                        Welcome to <strong>Helios Gallery</strong>, where creativity, artificial intelligence, and a dash of humor collide! we&apos;re required to give you some legal mumbo jumbo, so here it goes:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote style={{ fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#555' }}>
                        Sua sponte: Hereto within, both for consideration and exemplification in abeyance subject to
                        adjudication pro se and terms whereto superseding justifies the underscore until res
                        judicata thusly relieving ALL satisfactions. All parties hereby agree to wit habeas corpus.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Now that we&apos;ve satisfied the ancient spirits of legalese, let&apos;s get down to business.</p>

                    <h2>1. Privacy Is Overrated (But We Value Yours Anyway)</h2>

                    <p>
                        We firmly believe that privacy is both inconsequential and unimportant to you. If it were,
                        you probably wouldn&apos;t have a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account, and you certainly
                        wouldn&apos;t use search engines like Google. But hey, who are we to judge?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, to satisfy the absurd privacy requirements of various legal entities (and so you
                        understand exactly where you stand with us), we&apos;re pleased to present our privacy policy:
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

                    <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>When you use our Creative Canvas:</strong> We may collect your name, email address, and any
                            selfies you upload (preferably ones that wouldn&apos;t land either of us in an HR meeting).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>When you contact us:</strong> Any information you provide when reaching out for
                            support, sending us fan mail, or sharing your deepest secrets (just kidding, please don&apos;t).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>b. Usage Data</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Technical Data:</strong> Your IP address, browser type, device information, and a
                            history of the AI-generated masterpieces you create (yes, including that one).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cookies:</strong> Not the chocolate chip kind, unfortunately. We use digital
                            cookies to enhance your experience (more on that later).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> Tailoring content to make sure the Joke
                            Bot hits your funny bone every time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>To Improve Our Services:</strong> Analyzing how you interact with our site to make
                            it even more awesome (or at least 10% more amusing).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>To Communicate With You:</strong> Sending you your AI generated images or responding to
                            your messages (we promise not to spam—our Joke Bot handles that).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
                    <p>
                        We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal information. However, if the opportunity
                        arises to sell or otherwise use this or any information about you, we will jump at that
                        opportunity like a pitbull on a fresh steak. Just kidding! (Or are we?)
                    </p>
                    <p>In all seriousness, we may share data with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted partners who assist us in operating our
                            website (they&apos;ve signed strict NDAs—we checked).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If the Greek gods demand it (or, you know, if
                            required by law).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>5. Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        We employ industry-standard measures to protect your data. Our servers are guarded by
                        virtual dragons and encryption spells. However, no fortress is impregnable, so if someone
                        hacks us, blame the Titans.
                    </p>

                    <h2>6. Cookies (The Digital Kind)</h2>
                    <p>
                        We like chocolate chip cookies. By using our services, you agree to furnish any Helios
                        team members with fresh chocolate chip cookies upon request. That&apos;s the price of
                        using our programs and services (in addition to any other price we come up with).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wait, our legal team says we can&apos;t enforce that. Fine.
                        <br />
                        We use digital cookies to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Keep you logged in so you don&apos;t have to remember yet another password.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Understand how you use our site so we can make it better (like adding more dad jokes to
                            the Joke Bot).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>You can disable cookies</strong> through your browser settings, but be warned: your
                        experience might be less delightful.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>
                        Helios Gallery may contain links to other websites, like our team members&apos; personal blogs or
                        that hilarious cat video we couldn&apos;t resist sharing.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>We are not responsible</strong> for the privacy practices of these external sites.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>We encourage you</strong> to read their privacy policies (even if they&apos;re not as
                            entertaining as ours).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>8. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our services are <strong>not intended for children under 13</strong>. If you&apos;re a
                        tech-savvy kid genius, please get parental consent before joining the fun.
                    </p>

                    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may update this policy occasionally (usually after our legal team has had their coffee).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>We&apos;ll notify you</strong> of any significant changes by posting the new policy
                            here.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Your continued use</strong> of Helios Gallery means you&apos;re cool with the updates.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>10. Spam and Bacon</h2>
                    <p>
                        You agree that nothing we do with the access and information you grant to us shall be called
                        spam—even if it is. We prefer the term &quot;bacon&quot; because... mmmmmmmm bacon.
                    </p>
