      bio: "Ankit, known across the swamps and cities as The Florida Man, is a figure wrapped in both mystery and altruism. He is the kind of man who might be seen in the dead of night, wading waist-deep through alligator-infested waters—not for glory, but to retrieve a single flip-flop someone lost years ago. With a heart as vast as the Everglades, his acts of cryptic kindness have earned him both admiration and confusion. From single-handedly replacing the tires on a stranger’s car with unicycle wheels to returning lost grocery carts to their rightful homes from hundreds of miles away, Ankit operates on a different frequency of logic—one that only he seems to understand.",

I am originally from Greenville, SC and moved to KY for my graduate program. I received my undergraduate degree from North Greenville University in the booming metropolis of Tigerville, SC and also attended the University of South Carolina for a time (go Gamecocks!). I am a bootcamp/self taught developer and have spent time working in C#, Go, JS, and Python. In my free time (which, with 2 kids is minimal) I enjoy reading books, working on side projects, and running. A fun fact about me is that I have lost over 80 pounds since this time last year by running. I am a big fan of college football, board games, and video games as well! Thats all about me! I hope you enjoy our app!",

      bio: "In the depths of the earth's embrace, where roots tangle like secrets and darkness whispers long-forgotten tales, there lived a young soul named Will. Raised in the subterranean shadows, his world was painted in hues of deep soil and silent mysteries, a realm untouched by the sun's warm caress. But within this hidden sanctuary, Will found companionship in the most unlikely of creatures - turtles, wise and ancient beings who dwelled with him in the labyrinthine tunnels. With a heart as boundless as the underground rivers that flowed unseen beneath his feet, Will wove grand tapestries of imagination, spinning fantastical stories for himself and his shelled friends. Through the flickering glow of fireflies and the soft murmur of underground streams, he regaled his turtle companions with tales of daring adventures, noble quests, and improbable triumphs, each tale more elaborate than the last.",
