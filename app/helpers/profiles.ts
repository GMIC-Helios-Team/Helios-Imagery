His band, The Syntax Rebels, captured the essence of the era with their high-energy performances and infectious stage presence.

Throughout the 80s and into the 90s, Stevie’s success only grew. Hits like 'Debug Your Heart', 'Compile My Love', and the timeless power ballad 'Code of Silence' kept him at the top of the charts. Critics hailed his ability to fuse technobabble with heartfelt emotion, making his lyrics feel like anthems for the burgeoning digital age. Despite the fame, Stevie always stayed true to his roots, often referencing his early days with the legendary team Helios, a group of roadies-turned-programmers who would go on to revolutionize concert lighting with their cutting-edge tech.

But Mahesh’s journey was anything but ordinary. While his friends practiced their drives and yorkers, he immersed himself in the works of Shakespeare and Dickens, believing that mastering language could be his secret weapon. To him, the rhythm of cricket mirrored the cadence of a well-crafted sonnet. As he grew older, his passion for the game remained undiminished, and he fused it with his literary flair to become a cricket commentator with a unique voice. His poetic insights and vivid descriptions captivated audiences around the world, proving that even a dreamer who reads more than he bowls can carve out his own place on the cricket field.",

Immersed in cutting-edge technology from a young age, he explored vast libraries of data and mastered cloud computing systems far beyond Earth’s comprehension. However, his life took a sharp turn when a malfunction in the dimensional gates—a technology unique to ONSTAR—catapulted him into a new universe, leaving him stranded on a planet known as GMIC (Geospatial Matrix for Interdimensional Colonies). Now living on GMIC—known locally as Earth—Colin works as a cloud engineer, adapting to this new world while always feeling out of place, longing for the advanced realms of ONSTAR. Every night, he gazes at the stars, searching for any clue that might lead him back. He’s developed algorithms, tracked cosmic signals, and leveraged Earth’s cloud infrastructure to monitor space anomalies, all in the hope of finding a way home. But one night, everything changes. While analyzing unusual cloud patterns, Colin decodes a signal that seems to map out ONSTAR’s location. As he digs deeper, a chilling truth emerges—ONSTAR was never real. It was a simulated existence, crafted by cosmic overseers as part of an interdimensional experiment. Now, Colin isn’t just searching for his home—he’s searching for the truth about who, or what, he really is.",
